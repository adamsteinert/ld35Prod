	<h3>Three Body Problem</h3>

	<div>This is a simple platformer around the general theme of "shapeshifting."
		Play as a loose collection of three characters and traverse the map in search
		of coin and the exit.  There are three types of whirling enemies bent on your
		destruction.  Take care, your fire is only effective against enemies that
		are similar to your current form.  Thanks for playing!</div>


		<div>Controls:</div>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="command">S</span> Change shape</li>
			<li><span class="command">F</span> Fire at your enemies</li>
			<li><span class="command">V</span> Turn the music off.  Sorry, you're stuck with the sound :)</li>
			<li><span class="command">&uarr;</span> Jump/climb</li>
			<li><span class="command">&larr;</span> Move left</li>
			<li><span class="command">&rarr;</span> Move right</li>
		</ul>

  <div class="hints">Hints:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>When in "green form", scale walls by holding down the direction key toward the wall while pressing up.</li>
		<li>Different forms can get you into tight spaces that other can't.</li>
		<li>Think of this as choose your own adventure... the endgame is perhaps lacking.</li>
		<li>The water is a feature that didn't make the cut.</li>
		<li>Enemies continue to spawn throughout the game. Get rid of them to keep things tidy.</li>
		<li>Secret enemy teleport locations recycle them to a random spawn point.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="bugs">Bugs:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>Shifting to a new form sometimes lets you walk through walls</li>
		<li>On rare occasions you become invincible. Congratulations!</li>
	</ul>
